# Final Project of CS5100: Connect 4 AI

The game can be played from the `game.py` file. 
The standard ruleset is enabled by default.
Activating the "Fog of War" ruleset requires commenting out lines 138 through 143 and uncommenting lines 147 through 157 in `connect4.py`.
Similarly board sizes have to be adjusted by changing the values of `COLUMN_HEIGHT` and `ROW_LENGTH` at lines 1 and 2, respectively, in `connect4.py`
